## Description
Every year, the Gruff sheep will go to sæter. They must cross the bridge when they are ready, and you, the Pomp, must guide them to the other side.

An allegory for life, death, transhumance, and psychopomps, the sheep will always move forward towards sæter, much like the passage of time itself.

## Thoughts
I made this with a group of 4 for the Gumbo x GameMaker Jam 2024. The theme was bridge, so we had the idea of playing as a troll under the bridge that's repairing it and helping guide sheep to the end. It was the first game jam I'd done in New York, and the first time I'd worked with devs from New York. We also won the game jam which was cool too!
