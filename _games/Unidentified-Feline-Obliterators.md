## Description
Unidentified Feline Obliterators is a multiplayer arcade space shooter where you play as cats shooting deadly balls of matter in space! Their natural predators are the jetpack dogs, treadmill porcupines, and rocket rats. But what else is out there in space out to get these cats?

## Thoughts
In 2021, we made this for the Opera GX Game Jam! The theme was "UFO" and the goal was to create the next Chrome Dinosaur-like game for the Opera GX browser with drop-in multiplayer. Later on I submitted it to be in a custom arcade cabinet at Wonderville in Brooklyn, and it got to be there for 3 months. I did some extra work to get it working properly and some extra polish. I decided to keep working on it as a side project and release it with more content and polish (new bosses, skins, controller support, steam leaderboards, etc).
