## Description
Protest Sim is a choice-based game following the story of a community plagued by police shootings and brutality, and the social movement organization that rises up because of it. Take control of a socially active citizen in your community, and help guide the members of your town through these tumultuous times. But be careful, as the decisions you make have consequences, and will impact the course of the entire narrative.

## Thoughts
I focused most of my time on making parts of the game juicier, and more user friendly. As a team, we sat down a lot to discuss what we should do to make it clear what's going on in the game for players. We would run demo events to get data for the game, and change the game based on feedback. I implemented many features to the game such as saving, loading, analytics, more menu options, and a character database so the player can look back at any important character they met during play.
