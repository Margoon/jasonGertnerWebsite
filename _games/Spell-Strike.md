## Thoughts
I worked on Spell Strike as Lead Programmer in Spring 2018. At the beginning we brainstormed mechanics, and then implemented them into a separate version of the game. Our team collected data on these mechanics, and I fully completed the one that got the highest rating among players for how fun it was, and how easy it was to understand. I also helped on balancing levels, which involved getting data from people on which levels they felt might be too difficult.
