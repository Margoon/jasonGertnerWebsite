Midi the Siren is bored and feels like luring in sailors! Use your beautiful voice to lure them in and destroy their ships!

## LURE THE SHIPS!
Midi is bored and trying to find something to do! The sailors love the sound of your voice, use it to bring them in to sink their massive vessels!

## SINK ALL THE SHIPS!
The longer you sing for, the more sailors will come! Be careful though, if you get hit too much you won't be able to sing!!

## GET THE HIGH SCORE!!
Try to beat your friends! The higher your score the cooler you are, and the happier Midi is!!
