## Thoughts
Burning Wood was a small game I made in a game jam in 2 hours in February 2017 in my senior year of high school. I thought the idea was good enough to put it on phones, so I revamped it over the course of a couple weeks. This was my first game released anywhere, and I learned a lot through just the experience of making it and releasing it. Tons of people at my school were playing it, so many that some people didn't even know I made it! I always like to use Burning Wood as an example of how simple games can be fun and easy for anyone to jump in and play.
