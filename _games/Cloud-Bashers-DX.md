## Thoughts
Cloud Bashers was originally a game I released at the beginning of my first year of college. For a while it was my biggest game, and people called me the "Cloud Bashers Guy". It helped me get jobs, and was my first big game release! Now, with the help of some friends, we've made a deluxe version! It fixes a lot of balancing problems of the original, and adds quality of life updates, visual improvements, and a Daily mode (on the Steam version).
