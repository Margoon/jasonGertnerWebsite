## Thoughts
I was a programmer on Leap A Head, a puzzle game revolving around a snake jumping from block to block to reach a gem. I was part of Leap Long, a separate team dedicated to prototyping and analyzing additional features for future updates. We successfully brainstormed over one hundred ideas, as well as developed a brainstorming process for future teams. I was also QA for the team, and made sure every feature was bug free. Currently the team is now implementing those features into the base game.

## Prototyped Mechanics
