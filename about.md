# About Me
I'm a game developer, and I want to create more and more games. I've been super passionate about making games since I was eight years old; making fun experiences that other people can enjoy is what I want to always do. I like to experiment with new and unique mechanics, especially when doing game jams. My specialties include designing and programming multiplayer games, enemies and bosses, and making games that are small scope and fun.
